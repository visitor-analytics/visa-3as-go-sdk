# TWIPLA 3AS Go SDK

[![GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/visitor-analytics/visa-3as-go-sdk?status.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/visitor-analytics/visa-3as-go-sdk)

A simple API wrapper for integrating the Analysis as a Service (3AS) APIs provided by TWIPLA

## Getting started

1. [Create an RSA Key Pair (PEM format)](#creating-an-rsa-key-pair)
2. Send the resulting public key (`jwtRS256.key.pub`) to the TWIPLA Dev Team
3. [Install the library](#installation)
4. [Use the SDK instance](#how-to-use-the-library) to interact with the API

## Installation
```sh
go get github.com/visitor-analytics/visa-3as-go-sdk
```

## How to use the library

Please refer to the example on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/visitor-analytics/visa-3as-go-sdk)

## Creating an RSA Key pair

1. Create the keypair: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m PEM -f jwtRS256.key`
2. Convert the public key to PEM: `openssl rsa -in jwtRS256.key -pubout -outform PEM -out jwtRS256.key.pub`
